## 🚀 Running the Project (2 Terminals Required)

### ✅ Terminal 1: Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

---

### ✅ Terminal 2: Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔗 API Endpoints (Backend)

Base URL:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

Example endpoints:

* `GET /users` → Get all users
* `POST /users` → Create new user
* `PUT /users/:id` → Update user
* `DELETE /users/:id` → Delete user

## 🧠 Extensibility (How to Add New Fields Easily)

The user form is built using a **configuration-driven approach**.

To add a new field (Example: `Date of Birth` or `Address`):

1. Open the field configuration file (example):

   * `frontend/src/config/userFields.ts`

2. Add a new field object:

```ts
{
  name: "dob",
  label: "Date of Birth",
  type: "date",
  required: true
}
```

3. The UI will automatically render the field in the form and include validation.

✅ No major UI rewrite needed
✅ Minimal changes required
✅ Works for future fields

---

## 📝 Assumptions / Design Decisions

* Backend is kept separate for clarity and scalability.
* Form validation is handled on the frontend for better UX.
* API integration includes loading + error states.
* UI uses Ant Design for fast and clean layout.
